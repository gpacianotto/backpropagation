I have a data frame for classification in python that has 3 classes (csv file). The csv file is like this:

Begin
-Class A
-Class A
-Class A
-Class A
.....
-Class B
-Class B
-Class B
....
-Class C
-Class C
-Class C
End

But, I need that my dataframe's rows look like this:
Begin
-Class A
-Class B
-Class C
-Class A
-Class B
...
End
